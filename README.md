üëã Hello!

## WHO AM I?

<img align="right" height="256" src="https://github.com/hinell.png" />

* A Russianüá∑üá∫ self-taught Software Engineer with a broad skillset in software engineering; college dropout (2013)
* Since my college years I've been pursuing my career in Electronics & Software Design & Engineering

  * I've been tinkering around chemistry, biology, math, politics, etc. a lot of stuff
  * While on wikipedia, I made a side project: [HistoryHelper](https://github.com/hinell/historyhelper-wikipedia) <img height="14" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hinell/historyhelper-wikipedia/main/img/historyhelper-logo.svg" />, a plugin for Wikipedia that helps to link history entries to the talk pages to speed up creation of disputes

## HOW BECOME?
  <!--* Adobe Photoshop -->
* In 2013, during my college years I used to use ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-php-100000?style=flat-square&logo=PHP) for several small side-projects; no commercial experience; quickly grew out of it
* In 2014 I started to look forward to [![Link label](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-100000?style=flat-square&logo=node.js)][Node.js], ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-100000?style=flat-square-square&logo=javascript), 
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-100000?style=flat-square-square&logo=html5), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-100000?style=flat-square-square&logo=css3)
  * By this time ![JetBrains](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JetBrains-100000?style=flat-square&logo=JetBrains) editors like WebStorm were thriving, but ultimately I've switched to [![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Visual%20Studio%20Code-100000?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode)][Vscode-link]
* In 2015 I've started to learn & use ![GIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GIT-100000?style=flat-square&logo=GIT), ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-100000?style=flat-square&logo=typescript) (TypeDoc), and ![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Webpack-100000?style=flat-square&logo=webpack)
  * While learning TS I've contributed to the projects like [Definitely Typed]
* On the way I have learned a lot about web-related technologies (i.e.software), just to name a few:
  * Old shool ones: `VanillaJS`, `Backbone.js`, ![JQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JQuery-100000?style=flat-square&logo=jquery)
  * By 2017
    * I started to use GNU/Linux OS (Kubuntu: KDE Plasma etc.) in my everyday work
    * Backend:
      * ![Node.js APIs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js%20APIs-100000?style=flat-square&logo=node.js), ![Socket.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Socket.io-100000?style=flat-square&logo=Socket.io), ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-100000?style=flat-square&logo=Express),  ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-100000?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb) (Mongoose)

    * Sideproject: [Stigma], a schema validator
  * Graphics, a lot of math, trigonometry, WebGL 
    * A side project: Globular, a small TS/JS Geometry library
    * As of today I'm still continuing my journey toward OpenGL/Vulkan

  * üõ†Ô∏è I've mastered Node.js more, became accustomed to a range of different everyday tools like
    * ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NPM-100000?style=flat-square&logo=NPM), ![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Yarn-100000?style=flat-square&logo=Yarn), ![pnpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-pnpm-100000?style=flat-square&logo=pnpm), ![NVM](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NVM-100000?style=flat-square&logo=NVM), different VSCode extensions etc.
* By 2018: ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-100000?style=flat-square&logo=docker)
* In 2019 I've digged a lot into a C-language world and desktop/cross-platform applications:
  * ![C/C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C/C++-100000?style=flat-square&logo=cplusplus), `LLVM`/`Clang`/`GCC`, `ccache`, `Make`, ![CMake](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CMake-100000?style=flat-square&logo=CMake) (`Ninja`!), [build automation systems]
  * I also played a bit with CADs (like ![KiCad](https://img.shields.io/badge/-KiCad-100000?style=flat-square&logo=KiCad) FreeCAD, AutoCAD, SolveSpace, and KiCAD)
  * Played around with ![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Blender-100000?style=flat-square&logo=Blender)
* By August 2021 up to 2022, I'v been mastering Bash/Zsh ![zsh](https://img.shields.io/badge/-zsh-100000?style=flat-square&logo=zsh) (completion, general functionality, docs etc.)
* By 2022 I've mastered CMake (see [contribs][cmake merges]), ![gnu](https://img.shields.io/badge/-gnu-100000?&style=flat-square&logo=gnu) learned a lot about
  * LLVM tooling (clang-tidy etc.)
  * [GNU Core Utilities], like ![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bash-100000?style=flat-square&logo=gnubash) and `Make` (`AWK` a bit) scripting languages etc.
  * `Zsh`, a versatile, though not backwards compatible, bash replacement
* December 2022 - Researching Organosilicon chemistry, Photoresists (Electronics) 
* November 2022 - January 2023 - Switching from VS Code to [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), [neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/-neovim-100000?style=flat-square&logo=neovim) editor.
    * When Microsoft killed atom editor, I decided to move away from VS Code. 
    * This took me a while to setup a lot of things 
    * During this time I've learned alot about Lua & Vimscript languages, their environment. I'm now very confident in writing Lua code. Not a big deal.
    * Familirized myself with [GNU Make] ![gnu](https://img.shields.io/badge/-gnu-100000?&style=flat-square&logo=gnu)

## WHAT DO I DO NOW?
* April 2023 - Contributing to Neovim plugins,e.g.:

    * [nvim-cmp] etc.
* May 2023
    * I've learned in-depth idea dependency injection, modularity concept in programming languages, and an experimental [Newspeak] languages developed by Cadence Design Systems. Newspeak was dropped in 2009, but still serves a good example of enforced dependency injection: you can't get lost and know for sure where a certain symbol (class) comes from.
    * Contributing into [nvim-lspconfig] project: [PR#2609](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/2609)

    * PostgresSql: basic authentication, cluster management, Ubuntu SystemD service management (`pg_createcluster`,`initdb` etc.), some most common commands
    * pgadmin4-web ([data modelling] & [ERD tool])
    * PGModeller (ERD tool) - a part on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology
* June 27-28, 2023
    * In-depth learning of [GNU Make]
* July - August 2023
    * July 10-13, 2023: I deepened my knowledge in Quantum Physics and Quantum Chemistry (all of this is related to the chemistry, a broader approach to micro electronics engineering)
    * July 7-17, 2023: I've read book on UML by Grady Booch ___¬´The Unified Modeling Language User Guide, (1998)¬ª___ as part of MDE
    * July 25, 2023: [Model-driven architecture] & [Round-trip engineering]
    * August 20-23 - Learned about [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) command

    * September 28 - Contributed plugins for Neovim: [lsp-timeout.nvim] and [duplicate.nvim] 
    * September 30 - It took me full year to fathom Neovim ecosystem; Insanity!; now I know Neovim Lua API and Lua well
* October  2023
    * Made a bunch open-source contribs to neovim-related projects to imrpove my dev-x.
        * [vim-matchup](https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup/pull/326) 
        * [crazy-node-movement](https://github.com/theHamsta/crazy-node-movement/pull/6) - major overhaul; added new features 
        * [legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim/pull/412) - Keep history        
    * Some got rejected sadly by very rude and uncooperative maintainer:
        * [legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim/pull/415) - Mode aware functions
        * [legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim/pull/416) - Minor refactoring   
* November 2023
    * Wasted a week on improvements of some deeply flawed neovim plugin, but sadly, it got rejected on frivioulous grounds: [1](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua/pull/2560) [2](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua/pull/2551) [3](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua/pull/2550)
* December 2023
    * December 19 - Made [std.sh](https://github.com/hinell/std.sh) - a minimal standard library to detect operating system & package managers; easy to install
* February 5, 2024 - February 5, 2025 - Hired as part of a team to work on uPVC extrusion lines as an operator; thanks to my English knowledge it was my side-job; my duties included setting up extrusion lines for pipes production; the pipes we made were used for securing the boreholess of the well-drilling. I've learned a lof of industry-specific staff and about extruders. 
* March 2025 - Been heavily hacking on my [Neovim config](https://github.com/hinell/nvim), my terminal settings, and some cool private bash/zsh scripts used for project scaffolding

# Disclaimer üá∫üá¶
On Feburuary 24, 2022 a self-proclaimed President (with term ending in 2008 per  Constitutional limit) of Russia Vladimiar Putin has announced a so called ¬´Special Military Operation¬ª against the sovereign state of Ukraine üá∫üá¶. I do not support and share in any way this blatant and unjustified (IMO) encroachement on country's and people's freedom. Please help to stop the war - spread the word!
